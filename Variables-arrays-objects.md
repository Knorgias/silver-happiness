## variables, arrays, objects

#### variables are containers we can use to store data

For example 
```javascript
let x = 15;
let y = 62;
let z = x + y;
```

#### Arrays are lists of values like variables, objects or even other arrays

For example
```javascript
let iceCream = ["Vanilla", "Strawberry", "Chocolate"];
```

For example
```javascript
let meal = {
	appetizer : "tuna salad",
	main-dish : "steak a-la-creme",
	dessert : "black forest"
}
```
